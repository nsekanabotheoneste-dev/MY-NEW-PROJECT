Combinatorics and ProbabilityNumber of routes from a starting point to three other ports: 6.Reasoning: This is a permutation problem where you calculate the factorial of the number of destinations. For 3 ports, the calculation is $3 \times 2 \times 1 = 6$.Optimal route sequence: PAN, NY, AMS, CAS, HEL.Likelihood ratio selection: 13.Probability $P(8\text{-digits})$: 0.099.Posterior probability $P(\text{bot} | 8\text{-digit})$: 0.0808.Machine Learning and Nearest NeighborsModel Option Selection:First Instance: Option B.Second Instance: Option B.Third Instance: Option B.Optimal value for $k$: k = 42.Why is that $k$ value best?: it gave the highest testing accuracy.Reasoning: The "best" hyperparameter is chosen based on performance on a test set, which represents data the model hasn't seen before, to ensure it generalizes well.Neural Networks and Supervised LearningPredicted price for the cabin: roughly 233,000 euros.Type of machine learning problem: supervised learning.Reasoning: It is supervised learning because the model uses labeled training data (inputs paired with known target values).Reasonable baseline accuracy: 0.50.Classifying the majority class: 99% accuracy (classify everything as the majority class).
